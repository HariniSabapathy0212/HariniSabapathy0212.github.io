							<p>The enchanting city of Dubai was never like this years ago. It has changed over the last few decades. There is
								a vast gap between Dubai then and now. 
                <br>

                One of the main ways Dubai has changed over the past two decades is through the gigantic boost in its tourism. From a barren desert with a low population to welcoming over 15 million visitors in 2018, Dubai has outdone itself. Vivid thinking and far-fetched vision is the reason behind Dubaiâ€™s extraordinary recreational and leisure destinations.

                When the neighbors of Dubai are struggling to gain the international fame, Dubai is already enjoying the reputation of being the love of tourists. It has gained immense popularity among the
								foreigners from all over the world. The major reason behind the increased popularity and Dubai development is the
								attitude of the acceptance for all in Dubai. Dubai not just opens the doors to the newcomers but also gives them
								enough room to stay with complete freedom and ease. There is complete respect for the culture, values, and traditions
								of the ones coming to Dubai with dreams and hopes. It is this positivity that is allowing Dubai to develop by leaps
								and bounds. In these years the city has changed considerably. It has grown into a hub of economic, recreational,
								and cultural activities. There is a huge difference between the Dubai that, existed years ago and the Dubai that
								we can cherish today.
