<p>Dubai, being a most popular tourist destination, is pretty famous for its rich culture and traditions. Its rich culture and heritage reflects traditional Arab and Islamic values.. <br> <br>
         Although traditions from various cultures blend here to form a truly multicultural society, Dubai has held on to the traditional Emirati customs that have been carried through generations of Arabs living in the region.
         <br><br>
         One can find lots of tourist attractions where the heritage, culture and traditions in Dubai are displayed in a very tourist-friendly manner and can be discovered while on a vacation.</p>

              <h2>Arabian Hospitality </h2>
                Hospitality is central to everyday Emirati culture, and sipping Arabic coffee, or gahwa, is part of the warm welcome. This aromatic coffee is made with cloves, cardamom, cumin and saffron, and poured from a dallah pot into a small cup called a finjaan. Enjoy gahwa with dates while relaxing in the majlis, a comfortable meeting space traditionally used to host guests and catch up with friends

              <h2>Poetry and dance </h2>
                Poetry is in Arabic tradition with roots in the nomadic Bedouin culture, where it would serve to tell stories, deal with issues in society, welcome guests or entertain them on journeys across the desert. There are two prominent types   Nabati and Al Taghrooda. The colloquial Nabati poetry is simple and direct, while Al Taghrooda is chanted poetry performed back and forth between two people. Sometimes poetry accompanies the Al Ayyala folk dance traditionally performed during festivities or celebrations. Men hold canes and dance in rows to a steady drum to express unity</p></div>

              <h2>Ramadan </h2>
                The laws and culture of Dubai and the UAE are directly linked with Islamic tradition. And thereâ€™s no better time to experience it than during Ramadan, the Islamic holy month. Followers fast from dawn to dusk, and when the sun sets Muslims enjoy an iftar meal with friends and family.  Ramadan is based on the lunar calendar, so the dates move forward every year, ending with the public holiday for Eid al Fitr. </p>
